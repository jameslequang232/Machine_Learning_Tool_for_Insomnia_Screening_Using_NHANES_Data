    summary="Recall-Optimized Machine Learning Model for Insomnia Diagnosis",
    description="""
Hello, my name is James Lequang, and I am the creator of this diagnostic tool for insomnia. Below you can click on the Post/Predict button to use the tool to see if the model believes you have insomnia. In addition, you can view all of the input that the model will ask you in the Schema of the Post/Predict section and in the Features section. The tool is already pre set to the average value from the NHANES 2017-March 2020 Prepandemic Files used in this model. To receive the most accurate score from this model as possible feel free to change the input values to match your cicrumstance. However, I understand that taking the time to fill out much of this data could be tedious, so I would recommend filling out the input for the following: Depression, PHQ9 Total, Age, Weight, Waist Circumference, Weekday and Weekend Sleep Hours, and Caffeine Intake. This would result in a quick indicator to see if you have insomnia. Of couurse please be wary that this model is not always correct. The model has about a 95% accuracy at diagnosing insomnia, and my purpose was to give people the chance to quick self-diagnose themselves to see whether they should contact a medical proffesional. So please do not take the results too seriously and always follow the doctor's advice! Also the output will list the reasons behind its output at the Top Shap Features section I hope that you find this tool helpful!
